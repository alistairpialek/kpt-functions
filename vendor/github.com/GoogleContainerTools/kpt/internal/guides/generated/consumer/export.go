` + "`" + `kpt fn export` + "`" + ` reduces the work to run kpt functions in workflow orchestrators. It allows to export a workflow pipeline that runs kpt functions alongside necessary configurations. The generated pipeline files can be easily integrated into the existing one manually.

These quickstarts cover how to exporting workflow config files for different orchestrators:

- [GitHub Actions]
- [GitLab CI]
- [Jenkins]
- [Cloud Build]
- [CircleCI]
- [Tekton]
