var HelmGuide = `
*Any solution which emits configuration can also generate kpt packages
(because they are just configuration).*

Helm charts may be used to generate kpt packages which can then be further
customized directly.

## Steps

1. [Fetch a Helm chart](#fetch-a-helm-chart)
2. [Expand the Helm chart](#expand-the-helm-chart)
3. [Publish the kpt package](#publish-the-kpt-package)

## Fetch a Helm chart

##### Command

  helm fetch stable/mysql

Pull down a helm chart for expansion.  This may optionally be checked into
git so it can be expanded again in the future.

## Expand the Helm chart

##### Command

  helm template mysql-1.3.1.tgz --output-dir .

Expand the Helm chart into resource configuration.  Template values may be
provided on the commandline or through a ` + "`" + `value.yaml` + "`" + `

##### Output

  wrote ./mysql/templates/secrets.yaml
  wrote ./mysql/templates/tests/test-configmap.yaml
  wrote ./mysql/templates/pvc.yaml
  wrote ./mysql/templates/svc.yaml
  wrote ./mysql/templates/tests/test.yaml
  wrote ./mysql/templates/deployment.yaml

##### Command

  tree mysql/

##### Output

  mysql
  └── templates
  ├── deployment.yaml
  ├── pvc.yaml
  ├── secrets.yaml
  ├── svc.yaml
  └── tests
  ├── test-configmap.yaml
  └── test.yaml

## Publish the kpt package

The expanded chart will function as a kpt package once checked into a git
repository.  It may optionally be tagged with a package version.

  git add .
  git commit -m “add mysql package”
  git tag package-examples/mysql/mysql/templates/v0.1.0
  git push package-examples/mysql/mysql/templates/v0.1.0

Once stored in git, kpt can be used to fetch the package and customize it directly.

  export REPO=https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt.git
  kpt pkg get $REPO/package-examples/mysql/mysql/templates@v0.16.0 mysql/

The package local package can be modified after it is fetched, and pull in
upstream changes when the upstream package is regenerated from the chart
or otherwise modified.`
